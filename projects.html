The frontend is made with GitHub Pages and the backend is developed with SpringBoot. For my databases, I used SQLite.</h4>

                <h4 class="ptext">I worked in a team of 10 to help develop an educational indie game to educate users on computer science. My role consisted of creating a “key” system. Players would play games to earn “keys” which could then be used as powerups in other games (trivia, battles, etc.) I learned how to work using a SCRUM board which taught me a lot about AGILE methodologies. I also did a lot of documentation using GitHub Issues. The website is currently not deployed, so functionalities only work locally, however, linked below is the documentation my partner and I wrote following the process behind our part of the project (Initial mockups, frontend designs, API get and post requests on the backend). Working on getting a video demo up!</h4>

This project was used as my create performance task for the AP CSP exam (scored a 5 full score). The website is currently not deployed and only works locally so here is a demo on how it works:</h4>

                <h4 class="ptext">SIP is the Science Internship Program at the UCSC. Here, I worked with UCSC faculty to conduct computational media (CPM) research. I conducted literature review for 21 papers and designed studies on 2 user groups. I also developed Python scripts to create personalized learning tutorials for Blender, a 3D modeling software. To do this, I had to learn how to use Blender's built-in API and the Tkinter tool. My group presented our final research at a symposium.
