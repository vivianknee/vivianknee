I developed the website's databases and wrote a custom API to handle get and post requests. I also used Javascript Canvas to create custom animations for each sorting algorithm. The frontend is made with GitHub Pages and the backend is developed with SpringBoot. For my databases, I used SQLite.</h4>

                <h4 class="ptext">I worked in a team of 10 to help develop an educational indie game to educate users on computer science. My role consisted of creating a “key” system. Players would play games to earn “keys” which could then be used as powerups in other games (trivia, battles, etc.) I learned how to work using a SCRUM board which taught me a lot about AGILE methodologies. I also did a lot of documentation using GitHub Issues. The website is currently not deployed, so functionalities only work locally, however, linked below is the documentation my partner and I wrote following the process behind our part of the project (Initial mockups, frontend designs, API get and post requests on the backend). Working on getting a video demo up!</h4>

This project encompassed full-stack development to ensure a responsive user experience. The frontend was made with GitHub pages and the backend was made with Python Flask. This project was used as my create performance task for the AP CSP exam (scored a 5 full score). The website is currently not deployed and only works locally so here is a demo on how it works:</h4>
